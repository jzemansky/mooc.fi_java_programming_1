# mooc.fi_java_programming_1
All projects completed for the Java Programming 1 course at the University of Helsinki

The projects gradually increase in complexity starting from part 1 up to part 7.

These projects are intended to provide a basis of understanding of the Java language and are equivalent to a semester course in Computer Science.

After completion of the 7th part of these projects, an additional repository called mooc.fi_java_programming_2 will be created showing an additional 7 courses that constitute another full semester specialized in teaching this language.

The work shown in these projects is a combination of provided code from the University and my own work.

I received no outside help with these files.
